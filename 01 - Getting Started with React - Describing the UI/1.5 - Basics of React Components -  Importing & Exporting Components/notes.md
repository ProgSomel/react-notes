# 1.5 - Basics of React Components: Importing & Exporting Components

For react root component is **one**.
though. If you use a framework with **file-based** routing, such as **Next.js**, your **root** component will be **different** for every page.

**You may encounter files that leave off the .js file extension like so:**

```javascript
import Gallery from "./Gallery";
```

## Default vs named exports

There are two primary ways to export values with JavaScript: default exports and named exports. So far, our examples have only used default exports. But you can use one or both of them in the same file. **A file can have no more than one default export, but it can have as many named exports as you like.**

When you write a default import, you can put any name you want after import. For example, you could write import Banana from './Button.js' instead and it would still provide you with the same default export. In contrast, with named imports, the name has to match on both sides. Thatâ€™s why they are called named imports!

**People often use default exports if the file exports only one component, and use named exports if it exports multiple components and values**. Regardless of which coding style you prefer, always give meaningful names to your component functions and the files that contain them. Components without names, like export default () => {}, are discouraged because they make debugging harder.

```javascript
//? Named Import
import { Profile } from "./components/Gallery";
//? Default Import
import Gallery from "./components/Gallery";


export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <Profile />
        <Gallery />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
we can import files in one line. Like below:
```javascript
import Gallery, {Profile} from "./components/Gallery"
```

### We can also rename import name and it is called import alias
```javascript
//? Named Import
import { Profile as P } from "./components/Gallery";
//? Default Import
import Gal from "./components/Gallery";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <P />
        <Gal />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
